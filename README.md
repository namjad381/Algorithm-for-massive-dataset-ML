# Glasses or no Glasses
The aim of this project is to classify images with wearing glasses or not wearing it.
The dataset is based on GAN which is generative adversial Neural Network. GAN network creates images using 512 latent vector.
We use Neural Network for this classification problem. Apart from the GAN dataset , another image dataset was used to implement CNN for classification. There are two code files - one for gan and one for image dataset.
