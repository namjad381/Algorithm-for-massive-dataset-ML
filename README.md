# Glasses or no Glasses
The aim of this project is to classify images with wearing glasses or not wearing it.
The dataset is based on GAN which is generative adversial Neural Network. GAN network creates images using 512 latent vector.
We use Artificial Neural Network for this classification problem and tried to increase accuracy and performance of our classifier using different techniques.
